We got through Exercise: 4 (I spent almost an hour on exercise 2 trying to figure out how to cast
a double back to a biginteger. I realized only after i found a way that there was a bigfraction
constructor that took two ints as parameters -- probably a good lesson on why i should read the code
more carefully)
